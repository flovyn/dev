You are starting the **Planning Phase** for: $feature

The design has been reviewed and approved. Now create the implementation plan.

First, read the design document:
$design_path

Then create an implementation plan at:
$plan_path

The plan should include:
1. Phased TODO list with checkboxes (- [ ] task)
2. Clear, actionable tasks
3. Test plan
4. Be critical of what could be missed.
4. Any rollout considerations
5. Unless I gives you explicitly consent, in case of doubt, you can ask, otherwise, there is no 'Deferred/Optional' tasks.
6. Don't repeat what is already said in the design, you can refers to certains parts of it, if needed.
7. During planning, if you realize that the design document is wrong somewhere, fix it first, then plan later.

DO NOT start coding yet.
This phase is about planning HOW we'll implement the approved design.

When the plan is complete, inform me so I can review it before moving to Implementation.
