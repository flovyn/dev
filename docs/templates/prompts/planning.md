You are starting the **Planning Phase** for: $feature

The design has been reviewed and approved. Now create the implementation plan.

First, read the design document:
$design_path

Then create an implementation plan at:
$plan_path

The plan should include:
1. Phased TODO list with checkboxes (- [ ] task)
2. Clear, actionable tasks
3. Test plan
4. Any rollout considerations

DO NOT start coding yet.
This phase is about planning HOW we'll implement the approved design.

When the plan is complete, inform me so I can review it before moving to Implementation.
