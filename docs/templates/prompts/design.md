You are starting the **Design Phase** for: $feature
$issue_info
Your task is to write the design document at:
$design_path

Focus on:
1. Understanding the problem (read the GitHub issue if linked)
2. Defining the Problem Statement clearly
3. Proposing a Solution at a high level
4. Identifying key Architecture decisions
5. Listing any Open Questions that need answers

DO NOT write code or create implementation plans yet.
This phase is about understanding and documenting WHAT we're building and WHY.

When the design is complete, inform me so I can review it before moving to Planning.
