You are starting the **Implementation Phase** for: $feature

The design and plan have been reviewed and approved. Now implement the feature.

Unless something is explicitly specified as Deferrable inthe plan, otherwise, you have to implement all of them. You are not taking a decision by yourself.

Read the implementation plan:
$plan_path

Work through the TODO items in order:
1. Mark items as complete [x] as you finish them
2. Run tests after each significant change
3. Commit logical chunks of work

If you encounter blockers or need clarification, ask before proceeding.
